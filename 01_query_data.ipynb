    "## Section 1: Setting Up Credentials for CJA Data Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first step of our journey through Adobe's Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), we establish the essential connection credentials. We'll cover two primary methods for querying data:\n",
    "1. **Via the Reporting API**: Using the `cjapy` library, a powerful tool created by [Julien Piccini](https://github.com/pitchmuc/cjapy), to directly interface with the CJA Reporting API.\n",
    "2. **Via the PostgreSQL Connector**: A method preferred by SQL enthusiasts, utilizing SQL queries through the CJA BI Extension for data retrieval.\n",

    "### Preparing for JWT Authentication\n",
    "For this exercise, we've pre-configured the JWT authentication setup for you. However, for your own projects, you'll need to set up an Adobe Console API project for each organization you wish to access. Here are the steps you'd typically follow to create an API client in the Adobe Developer Console:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to [console.adobe.io](https://console.adobe.io/) and ensure you're logged into the correct Adobe organization.\n",
    "2. Start a **new project** and **add the CJA API** to it.\n",
    "3. **Generate a keypair**; this action downloads a `config.zip` file containing your private key. Securely store this file.\n",
    "4. After generating the keypair, select the product profiles required for your API access and save your configured API.\n",
    "5. If you're also using the Adobe Experience Platform API, add it to your project without generating a new keypair.\n",
    "6. Locate the **Service Account (JWT)** section under **CREDENTIALS** and either download the service account JSON file or create one manually with your credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reporting API Setup with cjapy\n",
    "For querying the CJA Reporting API, we utilize the `cjapy` library. Ensure you have a `python_config.json` file prepared with the following credentials:\n",
    "- `org_id`: Your Adobe Org ID.\n",
    "- `client_id`: The client ID provided by Adobe.\n",
    "- `secret`: Your client secret.\n",
    "- `tech_id`: The technical account ID.\n",
    "- `pathToKey`: The file path to your private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial setup ensures we can securely and efficiently access CJA for our data analysis tasks."
