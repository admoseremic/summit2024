    "## Section 2: Creating a Schema and Dataset in Adobe Experience Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) for data analysis and customer segmentation, you first need to create a schema that defines the structure of your data. This guide walks you through creating a schema designed for storing propensity scores, cluster IDs, and person IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Schemas**: Access the **Schemas** section from the AEP's left navigation panel and click on **Create Schema** in the upper right corner.\n",
    "2. **Select the Base Class**: Opt for **Individual Profile** as the base class, then click **Next**.\n",
    "3. **Schema Configuration**: Give your schema a descriptive name, such as \"Propensity and Cluster Data\", and click **Finish**.\n",
    "4. **Adding Fields**: Add the following fields to your schema:\n",
    "   - `clusterid` as Integer under a custom field group if necessary.\n",
    "   - `propensity` as Double.\n",
    "   - `personID` as String and mark it as an identity field, linking it to the identifier in use (e.g., ECID).\n",
    "   - Ensure you **Save** your schema after adding these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Dataset from the Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Datasets**: Find **Datasets** in the left navigation panel and click on **Create Dataset**.\n",
    "2. **Dataset Creation**: Select **Create dataset from schema**, choose the schema you just created (\"Propensity and Cluster Data\"), and click **Next**.\n",
    "3. **Configure the Dataset**: Name your dataset, for instance, \"Propensity Scores and Cluster IDs\", and finalize by clicking **Finish**.\n",
    "4. **Retrieving Dataset ID**: Locate your dataset in the list and note the **Dataset ID** on the far rightâ€”this ID is essential for programmatically adding data to this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding the Dataset to Your CJA Connection for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating your dataset in Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), the next crucial step is to incorporate this dataset into Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) for detailed analysis. Follow these steps to make your data actionable in CJA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add the Dataset to Your CJA Connection**: Navigate to your CJA connections and select the option to add a new dataset. Choose the dataset you've created, \"Propensity Scores and Cluster IDs\", ensuring you select the \"personID\" field as the identifier. It's crucial to select both \"backfill historical data\" and \"add all new data\" options to ensure comprehensive data integration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Configure Data in Your CJA Data View**:\n",
    "   - Open your CJA data view and locate the \"Components\" section.\n",
    "   - Navigate to the \"Profile Datasets\" folder within the components.\n",
    "   - Add \"clusterid\" and \"propensity\" as dimensions to your data view. This allows you to segment and analyze your data based on these attributes.\n",
    "   - Optionally, you can also add \"propensity\" as a metric if you plan to perform quantitative analysis on the propensity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these steps, \"clusterid\" and \"propensity scores\" are now fully integrated into your CJA environment, ready for use in Analysis Workspace. This enables a deeper understanding of customer behavior and segmentation, leveraging the rich data captured in AEP."
